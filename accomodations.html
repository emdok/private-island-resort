      Turtle Island Fiji is a stunning, 500-acre privately owned island—the ultimate vacation resort perfect for honeymoons, anniversaries, weddings, vow renewals or even to rent your own private island.  We accommodate just 28 guests at a time.  Each of our 14 bures (exquisite hand-crafted Fijian villas) are nestled along the famous “Blue Lagoon” and are separated from each other by generous expanses, meaning you’ll have your own slice of exotic island paradise.
